### UndefinedVSNotDefined

console.log(a);

var a = 7;

console.log(a);

JavaScript is  loosely typed language

automatically adaptive and flexible while assigning data to different datatypes.


#### Never do!
a= undefined;

undefined is a placeholder allocated to the variable by javascript execution engine. 
This is not good practice to allocated undefined as value to the variable.
